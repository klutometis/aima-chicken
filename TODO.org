* TODO Documentation!
  How should we do this: roll our own with org/html/latex, or use the
  chicken wiki? Some eggs are merely pointers to the "real" docs.

  Would be nice to have something R-like: autodocs for the
  public-facing functions (some S-expression-based intermediate that
  goes to latex/html?); a hand-crafted vignette for HOWTO.

  If we use docstrings, we can coöpt the reader; do we have to deal
  specially with things like =case-lambda=, parameters, scalars and
  procedures (both of the =define= and naked lambda flavors)?

  Should we check out what [[http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/][scribble]] has to say? Is it time to
  resurrect [[http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/][noweb]]?

  What about the language in the docstrings: latex, html, groff,
  markdown, docbook, restructured-text; any, all? Isn't it also
  uncomfortable to edit those sorts of things in strings without any
  editor support?

  Would it make sense, therefore, to have a documentation macro?

  Can the documentation itself be a Scheme structure along the lines
  of:

  It would be nice to parse the signature from the definition; we're
  going to have to understand e.g. keywords, rest and optional
  parameters, then.

  Would be nice to have a link to the purged source, too (i.e. sans
  docs).

  If you load the module doc,

  See [[http://www.metapaper.net/lisovsky/ad/mole/][mole]] and [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/contracts][contracts]], by the way. The reader-macro should no-op on
  the docs when the code is compiled; there will be a separate reading
  step, I take it, when we generate the docs.

  Start with support for latex; generalize this later? Would be nice
  to generate wiki, too. I think we can even pre-post-order the
  doc-expr, can't we? Meh; let's just iterate over it: populating an
  e.g. hash-table.

  How is that reader going to work: iterates over top-level forms;
  recursively descending into it for an instance of a doc-expr? In
  which case: I wonder if we can have two packages, doc with a @-noop
  and doc-parser with a @-parser. The latter is called from the
  binary; the former is included in code.

  I wonder if each code block could operate on some hash-table
  parameter (e.g. =current-doc-table=), referenced by
  =set-read-syntax!=.

  That way, we don't have to identify @-exprs: we simply descend
  readingly and the read-syntax takes care of the rest. Say we wanted
  to use a doc-form (i.e. =(doc "Description" (foo "Bar") ...)=)
  instead; could we simply define a relevant doc-macro? We'd have to
  eval the contents, though, which I'd like to avoid.

  So we descend readingly, populate the doc-table for that expression;
  now what? Can we identify whether we're dealing with a scalar,
  parameter, procedure or case-lambda? In cases where this is obscured
  by e.g. a surrounding =let=, can we give a hint via =procedure:=,
  =scalar:=, =parameter:= hints? Also, do we special-case modules for
  the cats that don't separate module-definitions from
  implementations? Is there a way to figure out which forms are
  exported from a module and only include those, unless we have an
  =export:= hint?

  We'd have to have first-class support for modules, probably; would
  this also entail descending into =includes=? What about module-less
  code?

  That whole first-sentence as overview, second as detailed
  description thing is current; should we go with it?

  If we iterate through the doc-expr, why not a data-directed dispatch
  an e.g. string, symbol and pair; and thence a data-directed dispatch
  on =(car pair)=?

  Is there a latex package, by the way, for typesetting docs? Looks
  like we might be [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/501241/can-latex-be-used-for-producing-any-documentation-that-accompanies-software][on our own]].

  For listings, try [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/minted/][minted]]; maybe there can be a source section at the
  end of the document? Will this make sense without the unexported
  functions? Can we list the whole fucking thing and selectively
  hyper-ref in there? Let's try.

  Let's document top-level forms for now; becoming module-aware later.
  This decision has the side-effect that module-definitions will have
  to be separated from implementations. Maybe that's not a bad thing
  (cf. etags).

  On the other hand, Pygments is pretty garish; also, how are we going
  to link in without line-numbers or other? Hmm: =minted= provides
  =listing=; provided that we don't want to list the entire file.

  If we take Moritz Heidkamp's suggestion, incidentally, and use a
  =doc= macro instead of the =@= reader-macro . . . lost my thought.

  Let's model the latex style after SRFIs; take [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html][SRFI-1]], for example:
  it has an abstract, rationale, &c. Can we just provide e.g. sections
  and arbitrary blocks of latex-formatted string? Sure. Or, how about
  =@(text ...)= blocks? How do we document such things in the
  self-same system? We can't!

  Do be able to do something like =cons* elt_1 elt_2 ...= or
  =make-list n [fill]= we're going to have to parse the parameter
  list; can we fake it, somehow? Also, there's a mapping to the type:
  =cons* elt_1 elt_2 ... -> object=.

  Should we formalize examples á la the following?

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (cons 'a '())        => (a)
    (cons '(a) '(b c d)) => ((a) b c d)
    (cons "a" '(b c))    => ("a" b c)
    (cons 'a 3)          => (a . 3)
    (cons '(a b) 'c)     => ((a b) . c)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  According to [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-69/srfi-69.html][srfi-69]], =undefined= is the result of void; srfi-69
  also uses legitimate arrows. It also prefixes things with
  ``Procedure:''; can we do the same for parameters, macros, scalars?

  This is an interesting artifact:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Procedure: alist->hash-table alist [ equal? [ hash [ args … ]]] → hash-table
  #+END_QUOTE

  Procedure name is in roman; args are in italics; witness the nested
  brackets. Examples done over a math-array would be cool: aligned
  over the assignment operator.

  Others, like [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-11/srfi-11.html][srfi-11]], specify procedures with angle-bracket-wrapped
  parameters:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (LET-VALUES ((<formals> <expression>) ...) <body>)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  See [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-13/srfi-13.html][srfi-13]]: yeah, let's go Olin Shivers style. Formal semantics,
  syntax, &c.? Not for now.

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (define (harro freunds)
      @("Say `harro' to freunds."
        (example (harro 'wirklich) "yes")
        (example (harro 'freunds) "jein")))
  #+END_SRC

  Special support for abstracts? See [[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/55922/name-a-section-in-latex-toc-add-subtitle-to-contentsline][subtitles in TOC]].

  Eventually, we want to pull all of the metadata out of =<egg>.meta=,
  or even populate the meta-file on the basis of e.g.
  =use=-statements. For now, though, we'll specify them with top-level
  forms.

  Damn: if we use the =listing= environment; we can have a
  =listoflistings=. Multipage listings are awkward, though: see [[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/12428/code-spanning-over-two-pages-with-minted-inside-listing-with-caption][this]],
  where they recommend using the =caption= package. Also [[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/7210/label-and-caption-without-float][this]], which
  is a more generic solution.
** TODO =case-lambda=
   We might have to have separate =docexprs= for every arm of the
   case-lambda: ouch.

   Or can we simply have unified parameter-docs with optional
   defaults?
** TODO Syntax
   Expand the syntax, then parse it; along the way, figure out what
   the fuck it is when expanded.

   Even =expand*= doesn't help decipher it; might just have to list it
   as something opaque: or provide a =formals= parameter?

   R5RS calls it [[http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%25_idx_118][library syntax]]; let's use R5RS as the target: it has
   support for examples which align on \Rightarrow, &c.

   It also has e.g.:

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   _library-syntax_: =(or <test_1> ...)=
   #+END_QUOTE

   where =<test_1>= is in italics (but only sometimes).
** TODO Line-numbers
   Is [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/4/Unit%2520expand#get-line-number][get-line-number]] useful? Only for compiled code, though.
** TODO Examples
** TODO SRFI vs. R5RS style
   Let's go with R5RS; cool stuff, like syntax vs. semantics. Oh, wow:
   in the case of [[http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%25_sec_4.2.6][quasiquotation]], they simply repeated the =syntax:=
   lines. We could also just use nested =[]=, but the formals for
   case-lambda need not be subsets of each other.
** TODO Forms that are unrecognizable.
   Macros, let-over-lambda; let's add some mechanism to override the
   parser.
** TODO =parse-docexprs= should be extensible.
** TODO Refer to other expressions in the same document with e.g. =\ref{foo}=.
** TODO Order them differently than they appear in the source code?
   Alphabetically, like R; or: according to conceptual groups
   (preferable)?
** TODO There's a disparity between what characters TeX and Scheme allow.
   This may bite us in things like labels; certainly, some escaping
   will have to take place.

  Can either have no-op environments that we graft in; or some other
  mechanism.

  Or, hell: instead of using the debug environments; why not have the
  classic debug-parameter that environments may or may not decide to
  use? That way, we'd have access to the agent's action as opposed to
  merely its state.

  . . . with e.g. =environment-print=; it's just going to be a thunk
  unless it does something special. Because we're not doing OO, we
  can't readily have a generic print which dispatches à la e.g.
  =for-each= on worlds, agents, miscellaneous objects.

  What about =display=, though, with =define-record-printer=? Wow,
  maybe we should bring records back for environments; despite the
  fact that they're merely wrappers around a step-function.

  Environment is distinct from world, though; the debug function could
  have an optional display-function that defaults to =display=. That
  means, however, that we need a debug function per entity, doesn't
  it? Maybe that's no big deal.

  Norvig did a wonderful thing, though: with this environment model
